# Contributing to Spudlab

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Spudlab**!
We’re an open-science community that builds tools, data systems, and experiments for everyone to explore, learn, and share.
Whether you’re fixing a typo, adding a feature, or launching a whole new project — you’re part of something meaningful.

This guide will help you get started and make contributing smooth, friendly, and rewarding.

## Our Philosophy

Spudlab is built on openness, collaboration, and curiosity.
We believe good science and good software come from shared effort and mutual respect.
No contribution is too small — every pull request, issue, and idea helps the project grow.

If you’re unsure about something, just ask! Maintainers and community members are here to help.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Find something to work on

* Browse [Issues](../../issues) for open tasks and ideas.
* Look for labels like `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
* If you have your own idea, open a new issue to discuss it first.

### 2. Fork and branch

1. Fork the repository to your own account.
2. Create a new branch for your change:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### 3. Make your changes

* Write clear, well-documented code.
* Follow the project’s existing style (or ask if unsure).
* Keep commits focused and meaningful — small steps are easier to review.
* If applicable, include tests and update relevant docs.

### 4. Commit and push

```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature: short description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Open a pull request

* Go to your fork on GitHub and click “New pull request.”
* Describe your changes clearly and link to any related issues.
* Be patient — reviewers may suggest improvements. That’s part of the process!

## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

If you’ve found a bug or have an idea:

* Search existing [Issues](../../issues) first.
* If it’s new, open a descriptive issue using the provided template.
* Include steps to reproduce (for bugs) or clear reasoning (for feature requests).

We aim for constructive, kind discussions that move things forward.

## Code Style and Standards

Each project may have its own preferred tools, but here are general guidelines:

* Keep code readable and modular.
* Document functions, classes, and data formats.
* Use meaningful variable names.
* Include tests where possible.
* Write commit messages that explain *why* not just *what*.

## Community Conduct

All contributors and maintainers are expected to follow our
[**Code of Conduct**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Be respectful, supportive, and curious — we’re all here to learn and build together.

---

## Recognition and Attribution

Contributors are credited in changelogs, documentation, and occasionally on the Spudlab website.
Major contributions (new tools, datasets, or designs) may be highlighted in future community updates or repositories.

## Questions?

If you need help, guidance, or just want to chat about ideas:

* Open a GitHub Discussion (if available)
* Reach out via the project’s contact email or [spudlab-xyz.github.io](https://[spudlab-xyz.github.io)
