We’re not experts — and that’s fine.

SpudLab exists because learning in public makes everything more interesting. You see the rough edges, the false starts, the sudden moments when something finally clicks. It’s messy, but it’s honest.

This isn’t about polished tutorials or perfect results. It’s about sharing the process of figuring things out. Each small discovery, mistake, or insight becomes a breadcrumb for whoever comes next.

If that sounds like your kind of environment, welcome. Pull up a chair, grab a notebook, and start experimenting. We’re learning out loud, one post at a time.
