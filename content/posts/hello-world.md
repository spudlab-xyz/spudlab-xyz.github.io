summary: "A small start with big curiosity — SpudLab begins as an open space to learn, make, and explore in public."
---

We’re starting small. A few ideas, a few experiments, and a lot of curiosity.

SpudLab isn’t a company, a research institute, or a finished idea. It’s a place to try things out in the open. Some of those things will work, most will probably fail — but that’s part of the fun.

The plan is simple: learn by doing, share what we learn, and keep building from there. Whether it’s code, sensors, or just notes about what went wrong, everything belongs out in the open.

If you’ve ever wanted to build something scientific, technical, or just interesting — even without knowing where to start — you’re in good company. That’s what this is all about.

We’re glad you found us. Let’s see where it goes.
