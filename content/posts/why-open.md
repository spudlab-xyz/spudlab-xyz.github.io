summary: "Openness isn’t about perfection — it’s about learning in public and building better ideas together."
---

We decided to make everything open from the start — even when it feels unfinished.

Openness isn’t just about code or licenses. It’s a way of thinking. When work is visible, it invites questions, ideas, and better answers. It turns one person’s experiment into something others can build on.

There’s a certain kind of honesty in showing your process. It means sharing mistakes, half-finished ideas, and unexpected results. It’s not always comfortable, but it’s real — and that’s how progress actually happens.

We don’t expect perfection. We expect learning, iteration, and growth in public. That’s what “open” means to us.
