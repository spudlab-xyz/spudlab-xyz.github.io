## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct.
They may take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior that violates these rules — including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent exclusion from community spaces.

All major decisions will be guided by fairness, transparency, and the well-being of the community.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all Spudlab online and offline spaces — including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, chat servers, and physical events.

It also applies when someone is officially representing the project or community (for example, using an official account or logo).

---

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it privately to the maintainers at:

**[contact@spudlab.xyz](mailto:contact@spudlab.xyz)**

All reports will be reviewed and handled with respect, confidentiality, and care.
We will respond as promptly as possible and communicate any necessary next steps.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct draws inspiration from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) (version 2.1) and the collaborative spirit of open science communities worldwide.

Thank you for helping make **Spudlab** a friendly, inclusive, and inspiring place for open science.
